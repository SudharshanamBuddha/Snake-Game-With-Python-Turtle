# Snake Game in Python 🐍

This is a classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module. The project incorporates object-oriented programming principles and provides a fun and interactive way to play the nostalgic Snake game.

## Features 🌟
- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.
- **Persistent High Score**: Your highest score is saved in `data.txt` and persists across sessions.
- **Simple Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- **Customizations**: Modify the game's appearance, speed, and boundary settings as you like.
